    "description": "Superteam helps promising Solana ecosystem projects in the ascending world (India, South East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa) launch and grow. We are a cooperative of creatives, developers, and operators experienced in launching and growing tech businesses.  We have two main goals: 1. Help Solana Founders Win: We believe in Solana's potential to power Web3 consumer adoption. We ensure builders have the talent, distribution, and partners they need. 2. Onboard Talent into Web3: Crypto enables people worldwide to work and earn at global rates, permissionlessly. We attract top talent in the ascending world to build a crypto-enabled future. This handbook helps newcomers contribute effectively. It covers everything you need to know about Superteam. Learn about our structure (see Community Structure resource) and our Core Values to get started."

    "description": "Superteam values the sovereignty of founding a company, the skin in the game of investing, and the joy of getting things done. In a pre-crypto world, we had to fit into limited categories. Web3 allows us to be free-range. We've built our community on the following core values: 1. Ownership Economy: People who create value should capture a piece of it. We see crypto as a tool to create and distribute wealth meritocratically at a time of historic wealth inequality. Less rent-seeking, more ownership. 2. Permissionless Work: Make it easy for people to contribute and get out of their way. Reduce middle management, recruiters, and bureaucracy. 3. Work Flexible Hours: The industrial era is over. It is time to control our work. Work the hours you want as long as you deliver. You’re accountable to the community, not a middle manager. The more you do, the more you own. 4. Work Remotely: Moving to a city and leaving friends and family to find a job is a thing of the past. Time Zone is the new location. All you need to do is be available on Discord, Crypto Twitter, Slack, and email. 5. Community GDP as a North Star: The core contributors are in service of using the resources of the collective (capital, distribution, time, etc.) in nurturing community GDP — the total wealth generated for the members of the group. 6. Fluid Squads > Calcified Structures: Leadership, if any, is ephemeral — for the duration and scope of the mission. 7. Multi-Chain Future: While we're committed to Solana's growth, we believe in a multi-chain future. Please leave maximalism at the door. We see Solana as critical infrastructure needed to create an open, financial internet and get a billion people to self-custody their private keys. 8. Decentralization means More Leaders: Decentralization means an abundance of leadership, not a lack of it. We acknowledge that every great company or project had the stewardship of a good leader — and our goal is to create many leaders who can ship value to the world, using the DAO’s common resources as a springboard to bring their ideas to life. 9. Forking > Voting: We must prioritize the creative autonomy of project teams rather than impose the burden of consensus on them. We view disagreements as opportunities to fork and start something, while ensuring a positive-sum outcome for all involved, rather than as opportunities to vote and impose the views of the majority on the collective. Forking Superteam should be seen as a collaborative, rather than a competitive, move."

    "description": "Superteam's Reputation System tracks Member contributions and awards XP, helping Project Leads identify reliable contributors. XP, like a DAO credit score, reflects the value added to Superteam and the ecosystem.  XP Allocation: XP is allocated based on Effort * Importance. Effort is the time spent multiplied by an Importance Multiplier (1.0-4.0), determined by Core Contributors and eventually the community. Factors increasing the multiplier include project impact, visibility, community benefits, complexity, reach, reception, talent brought in, and future business potential. Example Multipliers: 1.0 (ephemeral, non-critical project), 2.0 (lasting, attention-drawing project), 2.5 (complex project benefiting others), 3.0 (essential, beneficial project), 4.0 (flagship, long-term benefit project). The Reputation Leaderboard (https://reputation.superteam.fun/) showcases top contributors by skill set, and high XP can lead to high-paying projects and broader Web3 credentials. XP Sources: 1. Permissionless Bounties: Fixed, one-time XP for winning or reviewing bounties (https://earn.superteam.fun/bounties/). 2. Indie Contribution: Generally fixed, one-time XP for various contributions (essays, GitHub PRs, etc.) applied for via the #earn-xp channel in local Superteam servers.  5XP is awarded for attending community calls in India & Germany. 3. Contributions to Grant Projects and Permissioned Bounties: Variable, one-time XP awarded upon project completion. Project leads use an XP Claim form (https://airtable.com/shrVdwTsjIimrEiUm) to detail contributions, which are then multiplied by the Reputation Lead. XPawarded = ProRataContribution * Total Project XP * Multiplier. See the XP allocation doc for Superteam Earn (https://docs.superteam.fun/the-superteam-handbook/community/the-reputation-system/case-study-superteam-earn). Total Team Time is capped at 400 hours, and Individual XP at 3000XP. 4. Superteam Braintrust: Recurring monthly XP for Superteam core contributors: Full-time (700 XP), Project Leads (500 XP), Part-time/Other Assistance (250 XP). Grantees receive XP after contracts are effective."

    "description": "The Superteam Earn FAQ provides answers to common questions about participating in Superteam Earn opportunities. Types of Superteam Earn Listings: Q: What are Bounties and Projects? A: Bounties are competitive tasks where everyone participates, and the best submission(s) get rewarded, while Projects involve hiring a freelancer through a custom application form, with only the selected applicant completing the work. Q: How can I submit to a Bounty or apply to a Project? A: Sign up on earn.superteam.fun, verify your email, create a talent profile, and then select a listing to apply or submit. Q: Do participants receive an email confirming their application? A: Yes, participants will receive a confirmation email after submitting their application. Q: How is payment processed for winners? A: For Superteam/Solana-sponsored listings, winners receive payment within 7 days of submitting a form after completing KYC. For external sponsors, payment is sent to the wallet linked to the winner’s Superteam Earn account, with some sponsors requiring invoices or KYC. Q: When working in teams, who should submit the application? A: Ideally, only the team lead should submit the application to avoid redundancy and simplify payment processing. Q: Can I modify my submission after applying? A: No, changes cannot be made after submitting on Earn. Q: Do I need to post my submission on Twitter? A: It’s not mandatory, but we recommend tweeting your work for more exposure and easier discovery by sponsors. Rewards/Payouts on Superteam Earn: Q: What are the perks of winning a bounty or project? A: Winners receive payment, and some listings offer additional perks like NFTs, merch, and an invitation to join Superteam as a Member/Contributor. Winners also earn XP, but only if they are invited to the community as a contributor/member. Q: How can I get the member/contributor role through Superteam Earn? A: Some listings offer an invitation to become a Member/Contributor. Exceptional submissions may also be awarded this status even if not explicitly stated in the listing. Q: Do all listings provide membership as a perk? A: No, not all listings offer membership; some only provide rewards like prizes or payment. Q: How are team rewards managed? A: The payment goes to the wallet of the team member (usually the lead) who made the submission. The team is free to divide the reward as they see fit. Announcements & Notifications: Q: How are winners announced? A: Winners are notified and listed on the specific listings once announced. Q: How can I stay updated on new listings? A: Click on the Notify Me button on the category page to receive notifications when new listings are added. XP Allocation: Q: How much XP can I earn for winning a bounty or project? A: XP allocation is as follows: 1st place receives 80 XP, 2nd place receives 60 XP, and 3rd place receives 50 XP. For teams, XP is evenly distributed among team members. Policy: Q: What is the plagiarism policy? A: Submissions with over 15% plagiarism may be disqualified, and repeat offenders may be permanently banned from Earn. We recommend checking submissions for plagiarism before submitting. Q: Can deadlines be extended? A: Only the sponsor can extend the deadline. Participants do not need to take any action if the deadline is extended after submission. Q: If the prize includes membership, who gets the role? A: All teammates will receive the role if it’s part of the prize. Evaluation: Q: How are winners decided? A: Sponsors review submissions and select winners, though sometimes Superteam’s brain-trust members may assist with evaluation. Sponsor Referrals: Q: How can I refer a sponsor to Superteam? A: You can reach out to @pratikdholani on Telegram (https://t.me/pratikdholani) or Twitter(https://x.com/pratikdholani) to refer a sponsor. Sponsors: Q: How are sponsors selected to list on Superteam Earn? A: Any Solana project can sponsor a listing on Superteam Earn. If assistance is needed in setting up, contact @pratikdholani on Telegram or Twitter. Miscellaneous: Q: How can I report bugs or provide feedback? A: Reach out to hello@superteamearn.com for bug reports or feedback. Superteam Earn is open source, feel free to contribute to our GitHub repo!: https://github.com/SuperteamDAO/earn Got questions? We have most of the answers. How do I get involved in the community? Get involved in Discord. Ask questions, share resources, and generally contribute to the conversation. If you build/write/see something interesting, share it in Discord! Get to know other people in the community. The easiest way is to see who is active on Discord or on our Reputation Board (https://reputation.superteam.fun/) and shoot them a DM asking for a quick 15-minute intro meeting. We’re a friendly bunch! I have an idea for a project, what should I do? Apply for an Instagrant (https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/)! We’d love to give you between $1,000 - $10,000 (smaller is easier!) to build out your concept. What benefits do Members get relative to Contributors? Members get access to project channels in Discord (for easier contribution), access to Working Groups, preferential treatment on Instagrants, and additional benefits of Superteam’s distribution (e.g., sharing on social, ecosystem introductions, etc.). How do I become a Member? Consistently help other Superteam Members and contribute to Superteam projects, earning XP. Win a Grant. I have another question not answered here? Feel free to drop us a note at support@superteam.fun."
