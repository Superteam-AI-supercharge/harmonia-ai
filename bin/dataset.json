    "description": "FAQs | The Superteam Handbook How do I get involved in the community? I have an idea for a project, what should I do? What benefits do Members get relative to Contributors? Can I make changes to my submission after submitting it? Currently no, that's not possible on Earn.Do I need to post my submission on Twitter (for listings which are not Twitter thread bounties)? While it’s not mandatory, we recommend that participants tweet out their work so that: We can RT the best entries to give them more exposure, and It makes it easier for sponsors to discover the participant's submission. How do I become a Member? I have another question not answered here? Community \u2753Got questions? We have most of the answers. How do I get involved in the community? Get involved in Discord. Ask questions, share resources, and generally contribute to the conversation. If you build/write/see something interesting, share it in Discord! Get to know other people in the community. The easiest way is to see who is active on Discord or on our Reputation Board and shoot them a DM asking for a quick 15 minute intro meeting. We\u2019re a friendly bunch! I have an idea for a project, what should I do? Apply for an Instagrant! We\u2019d love to give you between $1,000 - $10,000 (smaller is easier!) to build out your concept. What benefits do Members get relative to Contributors? Members get access to project channels in Discord (for easier contribution), access to Working Groups, preferential treatment on Instagrants, and additional benefits of Superteam\u2019s distribution (e.g. sharing on social, ecosystem introductions, etc). How do I become a Member? Consistently help other Superteam Members and contribute to Superteam projects, earning XP. Win a Grant I have another question not answered here? Feel free to drop us a note at support@superteam.fun."

    "description": "The Superteam Earn FAQ provides answers to common questions about participating in Superteam Earn opportunities.\n\n**Types of Superteam Earn Listings**\n\n**Q:** What are Bounties and Projects?\n**A:** Bounties are competitive tasks where everyone participates, and the best submission(s) get rewarded, while Projects involve hiring a freelancer through a custom application form, with only the selected applicant completing the work.\n\n**Q:** How can I submit to a Bounty or apply to a Project?\n**A:** Sign up on earn.superteam.fun, verify your email, create a talent profile, and then select a listing to apply or submit.\n\n**Q:** Do participants receive an email confirming their application?\n**A:** Yes, participants will receive a confirmation email after submitting their application.\n\n**Q:** How is payment processed for winners?\n**A:** For Superteam/Solana-sponsored listings, winners receive payment within 7 days of submitting a form after completing KYC. For external sponsors, payment is sent to the wallet linked to the winner’s Superteam Earn account, with some sponsors requiring invoices or KYC.\n\n**Q:** When working in teams, who should submit the application?\n**A:** Ideally, only the team lead should submit the application to avoid redundancy and simplify payment processing.\n\n**Q:** Can I modify my submission after applying?\n**A:** No, changes cannot be made after submitting on Earn.\n\n**Q:** Do I need to post my submission on Twitter?\n**A:** It’s not mandatory, but we recommend tweeting your work for more exposure and easier discovery by sponsors.\n\n**Rewards/Payouts on Superteam Earn**\n\n**Q:** What are the perks of winning a bounty or project?\n**A:** Winners receive payment, and some listings offer additional perks like NFTs, merch, and an invitation to join Superteam as a Member/Contributor. Winners also earn XP, but only if they are invited to the community as a contributor/member.\n\n**Q:** How can I get the member/contributor role through Superteam Earn?\n**A:** Some listings offer an invitation to become a Member/Contributor. Exceptional submissions may also be awarded this status even if not explicitly stated in the listing.\n\n**Q:** Do all listings provide membership as a perk?\n**A:** No, not all listings offer membership; some only provide rewards like prizes or payment.\n\n**Q:** How are team rewards managed?\n**A:** The payment goes to the wallet of the team member (usually the lead) who made the submission. The team is free to divide the reward as they see fit.\n\n**Announcements & Notifications**\n\n**Q:** How are winners announced?\n**A:** Winners are notified and listed on the specific listings once announced.\n\n**Q:** How can I stay updated on new listings?\n**A:** Click on the Notify Me button on the category page to receive notifications when new listings are added.\n\n**XP Allocation**\n\n**Q:** How much XP can I earn for winning a bounty or project?\n**A:** XP allocation is as follows: 1st place receives 80 XP, 2nd place receives 60 XP, and 3rd place receives 50 XP. For teams, XP is evenly distributed among team members.\n\n**Policy**\n\n**Q:** What is the plagiarism policy?\n**A:** Submissions with over 15% plagiarism may be disqualified, and repeat offenders may be permanently banned from Earn. We recommend checking submissions for plagiarism before submitting.\n\n**Q:** Can deadlines be extended?\n**A:** Only the sponsor can extend the deadline. Participants do not need to take any action if the deadline is extended after submission.\n\n**Q:** If the prize includes membership, who gets the role?\n**A:** All teammates will receive the role if it’s part of the prize.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n**Q:** How are winners decided?\n**A:** Sponsors review submissions and select winners, though sometimes Superteam’s brain-trust members may assist with evaluation.\n\n**Sponsor Referrals**\n\n**Q:** How can I refer a sponsor to Superteam?\n**A:** You can reach out to @pratikdholani on Telegram (https://t.me/pratikdholani) or Twitter(https://x.com/pratikdholani) to refer a sponsor.\n\n**Sponsors**\n\n**Q:** How are sponsors selected to list on Superteam Earn?\n**A:** Any Solana project can sponsor a listing on Superteam Earn. If assistance is needed in setting up, contact @pratikdholani on Telegram or Twitter.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n**Q:** How can I report bugs or provide feedback?\n**A:** Reach out to hello@superteamearn.com for bug reports or feedback."
