    "description": "FAQs | The Superteam Handbook How do I get involved in the community? I have an idea for a project, what should I do? What benefits do Members get relative to Contributors? Can I make changes to my submission after submitting it? Currently no, that's not possible on Earn.Do I need to post my submission on Twitter (for listings which are not Twitter thread bounties)? While it’s not mandatory, we recommend that participants tweet out their work so that: We can RT the best entries to give them more exposure, and It makes it easier for sponsors to discover the participant's submission. How do I become a Member? I have another question not answered here? Community \u2753Got questions? We have most of the answers. How do I get involved in the community? Get involved in Discord. Ask questions, share resources, and generally contribute to the conversation. If you build/write/see something interesting, share it in Discord! Get to know other people in the community. The easiest way is to see who is active on Discord or on our Reputation Board and shoot them a DM asking for a quick 15 minute intro meeting. We\u2019re a friendly bunch! I have an idea for a project, what should I do? Apply for an Instagrant! We\u2019d love to give you between $1,000 - $10,000 (smaller is easier!) to build out your concept. What benefits do Members get relative to Contributors? Members get access to project channels in Discord (for easier contribution), access to Working Groups, preferential treatment on Instagrants, and additional benefits of Superteam\u2019s distribution (e.g. sharing on social, ecosystem introductions, etc). How do I become a Member? Consistently help other Superteam Members and contribute to Superteam projects, earning XP. Win a Grant I have another question not answered here? Feel free to drop us a note at support@superteam.fun."
