You\u2019ll get more used to it as you contribute more to the community. Community\ud83d\udcaaThe Reputation System\u200bIn our community, being able to know who to trust and who has proven shipping abilities is essential. Our (work-in-progress) Reputation System captures Member contributions and gives them XP so that Project Leads know which Members are reliable.As Superteam grows globally, a reputation system of all geographies will eventually form the front page of each one and reflect who are the most active folks in the communities.Hence, XP points are like your DAO Credit Score - they are a reflection of the value you have added to Superteam as well as the larger ecosystem using your skills and intent.How are XPs allocated?They are allocated on the basis of a simple formula: XP = (Effort) * (Importance).\u200bEffort is determined by the amount of time you worked on a project. However, measuring only the number of hours you worked would incentivize doing busywork, which we don\u2019t want. For that reason, we multiply the amount of time you invested by an Importance Multiplier. \u200bThe Importance multiplier is inherently subjective. Currently, it is determined by the Core Contributors, though over time the community as a whole will be more involved.\u200bThe multiplier is a number ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. A low multiplier is applied to projects that are useful but not ground-breaking, while a high multiplier is given for critical or impactful projects. \u200bThe following factors may increase the XP multiplier score:\u200bProject team's suggested XP multiplier (self-reported)\u200bImpact of the project\u200bVisibility of the project\u200bBenefits to the community\u200bComplexity of the project\u200bReach of the project\u200bReception of the project\u200bBringing in more talent to the community\u200bCreating more business in the future for community members\u200bExample Multipliers\u200bWe're still developing clear standards for determining the XP Multiplier. Until then, here are example projects with associated multipliers:\u200b1.0 multiplier - a project that shipped, but was ephemeral and non-critical for the DAO.\u200b2.0 multiplier - a great straightforward project that is likely to be lasting and draw attention to the DAO. May result in future project work for the DAO.\u200b2.5 multiplier - a great complicated project that is likely to lead to other Members earning more (ex. Ketto Token Research)\u200b3.0 - an essential project for the DAO that creates immediate benefits (ex. Earnings Dashboard)\u200b4.0 - a flagship project for the DAO that brings many long-term benefits to the community (ex. Start on Solana)\u200bThe Reputation Leaderboard showcases the top contributors by skillset. Members with a lot of XP get asked to join high-paying and highly interesting projects. You can also use your XP in Superteam as a credential for working in Web3 more broadly. XP sources:There are four sources of XP:1. Permissionless BountiesType: Fixed and one-time XP, available for winning a bounty or reviewing a bounty.XPs for bounty wins are awarded automatically, when and if you've been invited to the community in any capacity, i.e., there is no need to fill out any forms for this.Find open bounties here.2. Indie ContributionType: Generally, fixed and one-time XP.Indie contributions take various forms - some with pre-defined XP listed in the XP Menu below, others requiring separate application. Upon approval by designated reviewers, the XP is awarded.Claim XP for an Indie contribution by posting a live link to your contribution (essays, merged GitHub PRs, etc.) on the #earn-xp channel in your Local Superteam server.The XP menu can be customized by your local Superteam lead. For more details, check the #earn-xp channel.Members of Superteam India & Germany receive 5XP for each community call they attend - this is automatically allocated i.e., there is no need to fill out any forms for this.3. Contributions to Grant Projects and Permissioned BountiesType: Variable and one-time XP, awarded once the project is shipped and marked as completed.For each project, the project lead is required to fill in the XP Claim form. He/she/they is/are accountable for presenting both qualitative and quantitative information about the team members' contributions, taking into account their significance and relevance to the project.The Reputation Lead will then add a multiplier to the final XP allocated.XPawarded = ProRataContribution * Total Project XP * MultiplierIn case you're uncertain about time and multiplier estimates, refer to this doc on XP allocation for Superteam Earn.Note: We ensure fair allocation of XPs across all projects by capping Total Time taken by the entire Team to reach their self-declared goal at 400 hours and limiting Individual XP to 3000XP.4. Superteam BraintrustMembers engaged in part-time/full-time community-focused work within Superteam receive fixed, recurring XP on a monthly basis, automatically granted at the end of each month.The amount of XP allotted per month is based on the tier of work, which is as follows:Full-time work: 700 XPProject leads: 500 XPPart-time work and other assistance: 250 XPGrantees shall start receiving XP once their contracts are effective.Note: If this feels a bit confusing right now, don\u2019t worry.

Indie ContributionType: Generally, fixed and one-time XP.Indie contributions take various forms - some with pre-defined XP listed in the XP Menu below, others requiring separate application. Upon approval by designated reviewers, the XP is awarded.Claim XP for an Indie contribution by posting a live link to your contribution (essays, merged GitHub PRs, etc.) on the #earn-xp channel in your Local Superteam server.The XP menu can be customized by your local Superteam lead.

Why We Focus on Community GDPHow to Contribute to Community GDPGetting Involved\ud83d\udcb8Community GDPOur North Star metricWhat is Community GDP? The Community GDP is our North Star metric. It captures the total amount of earning opportunities community members have created for each other. These opportunities may come in the form of bounties, jobs, grants, or other ad hoc work. Why We Focus on Community GDPFirst, the obvious reason: we believe that working (rather than speculating) in crypto is the best way to gain financial freedom. Focusing on how much our community earns - and orienting the structure of the community in that direction - is fundamental. Second, the less obvious reason: measuring earnings is the closest we can get to measuring the value created by the community. Just as GDP is an imprecise measure of an economy, Community GDP is an imprecise measure of our community. But, like with traditional economies, it's the closest we can get to seeing how productive we are. How to Contribute to Community GDPIf you earned through an opportunity created by another person in the Superteam community, you'e eligible to contribute to the Community GDP. Simply fill in this short form (~20 seconds) to get started. Contributing to Community GDP is the highest value thing a Superteam member can do. That's why every week we celebrate earners on the Community Call and have an entire Discord channel (#good-news) dedicated to recognizing earners.

You\u2019ll get more used to it as you contribute more to the community. Community\ud83d\udcaaThe Reputation System\u200bIn our community, being able to know who to trust and who has proven shipping abilities is essential. Our (work-in-progress) Reputation System captures Member contributions and gives them XP so that Project Leads know which Members are reliable.As Superteam grows globally, a reputation system of all geographies will eventually form the front page of each one and reflect who are the most active folks in the communities.Hence, XP points are like your DAO Credit Score - they are a reflection of the value you have added to Superteam as well as the larger ecosystem using your skills and intent.How are XPs allocated?They are allocated on the basis of a simple formula: XP = (Effort) * (Importance).\u200bEffort is determined by the amount of time you worked on a project. However, measuring only the number of hours you worked would incentivize doing busywork, which we don\u2019t want. For that reason, we multiply the amount of time you invested by an Importance Multiplier. \u200bThe Importance multiplier is inherently subjective. Currently, it is determined by the Core Contributors, though over time the community as a whole will be more involved.\u200bThe multiplier is a number ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. A low multiplier is applied to projects that are useful but not ground-breaking, while a high multiplier is given for critical or impactful projects. \u200bThe following factors may increase the XP multiplier score:\u200bProject team's suggested XP multiplier (self-reported)\u200bImpact of the project\u200bVisibility of the project\u200bBenefits to the community\u200bComplexity of the project\u200bReach of the project\u200bReception of the project\u200bBringing in more talent to the community\u200bCreating more business in the future for community members\u200bExample Multipliers\u200bWe're still developing clear standards for determining the XP Multiplier. Until then, here are example projects with associated multipliers:\u200b1.0 multiplier - a project that shipped, but was ephemeral and non-critical for the DAO.\u200b2.0 multiplier - a great straightforward project that is likely to be lasting and draw attention to the DAO. May result in future project work for the DAO.\u200b2.5 multiplier - a great complicated project that is likely to lead to other Members earning more (ex. Ketto Token Research)\u200b3.0 - an essential project for the DAO that creates immediate benefits (ex. Earnings Dashboard)\u200b4.0 - a flagship project for the DAO that brings many long-term benefits to the community (ex. Start on Solana)\u200bThe Reputation Leaderboard showcases the top contributors by skillset. Members with a lot of XP get asked to join high-paying and highly interesting projects. You can also use your XP in Superteam as a credential for working in Web3 more broadly. XP sources:There are four sources of XP:1. Permissionless BountiesType: Fixed and one-time XP, available for winning a bounty or reviewing a bounty.XPs for bounty wins are awarded automatically, when and if you've been invited to the community in any capacity, i.e., there is no need to fill out any forms for this.Find open bounties here.2. Indie ContributionType: Generally, fixed and one-time XP.Indie contributions take various forms - some with pre-defined XP listed in the XP Menu below, others requiring separate application. Upon approval by designated reviewers, the XP is awarded.Claim XP for an Indie contribution by posting a live link to your contribution (essays, merged GitHub PRs, etc.) on the #earn-xp channel in your Local Superteam server.The XP menu can be customized by your local Superteam lead. For more details, check the #earn-xp channel.Members of Superteam India & Germany receive 5XP for each community call they attend - this is automatically allocated i.e., there is no need to fill out any forms for this.3. Contributions to Grant Projects and Permissioned BountiesType: Variable and one-time XP, awarded once the project is shipped and marked as completed.For each project, the project lead is required to fill in the XP Claim form. He/she/they is/are accountable for presenting both qualitative and quantitative information about the team members' contributions, taking into account their significance and relevance to the project.The Reputation Lead will then add a multiplier to the final XP allocated.XPawarded = ProRataContribution * Total Project XP * MultiplierIn case you're uncertain about time and multiplier estimates, refer to this doc on XP allocation for Superteam Earn.Note: We ensure fair allocation of XPs across all projects by capping Total Time taken by the entire Team to reach their self-declared goal at 400 hours and limiting Individual XP to 3000XP.4. Superteam BraintrustMembers engaged in part-time/full-time community-focused work within Superteam receive fixed, recurring XP on a monthly basis, automatically granted at the end of each month.The amount of XP allotted per month is based on the tier of work, which is as follows:Full-time work: 700 XPProject leads: 500 XPPart-time work and other assistance: 250 XPGrantees shall start receiving XP once their contracts are effective.Note: If this feels a bit confusing right now, don\u2019t worry.

Our (work-in-progress) Reputation System captures Member contributions and gives them XP so that Project Leads know which Members are reliable.As Superteam grows globally, a reputation system of all geographies will eventually form the front page of each one and reflect who are the most active folks in the communities.Hence, XP points are like your DAO Credit Score - they are a reflection of the value you have added to Superteam as well as the larger ecosystem using your skills and intent.How are XPs allocated?They are allocated on the basis of a simple formula: XP = (Effort) * (Importance).\u200bEffort is determined by the amount of time you worked on a project. However, measuring only the number of hours you worked would incentivize doing busywork, which we don\u2019t want.

You\u2019ll get more used to it as you contribute more to the community. Community\ud83d\udcaaThe Reputation System\u200bIn our community, being able to know who to trust and who has proven shipping abilities is essential. Our (work-in-progress) Reputation System captures Member contributions and gives them XP so that Project Leads know which Members are reliable.As Superteam grows globally, a reputation system of all geographies will eventually form the front page of each one and reflect who are the most active folks in the communities.Hence, XP points are like your DAO Credit Score - they are a reflection of the value you have added to Superteam as well as the larger ecosystem using your skills and intent.How are XPs allocated?They are allocated on the basis of a simple formula: XP = (Effort) * (Importance).\u200bEffort is determined by the amount of time you worked on a project. However, measuring only the number of hours you worked would incentivize doing busywork, which we don\u2019t want. For that reason, we multiply the amount of time you invested by an Importance Multiplier. \u200bThe Importance multiplier is inherently subjective. Currently, it is determined by the Core Contributors, though over time the community as a whole will be more involved.\u200bThe multiplier is a number ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. A low multiplier is applied to projects that are useful but not ground-breaking, while a high multiplier is given for critical or impactful projects. \u200bThe following factors may increase the XP multiplier score:\u200bProject team's suggested XP multiplier (self-reported)\u200bImpact of the project\u200bVisibility of the project\u200bBenefits to the community\u200bComplexity of the project\u200bReach of the project\u200bReception of the project\u200bBringing in more talent to the community\u200bCreating more business in the future for community members\u200bExample Multipliers\u200bWe're still developing clear standards for determining the XP Multiplier. Until then, here are example projects with associated multipliers:\u200b1.0 multiplier - a project that shipped, but was ephemeral and non-critical for the DAO.\u200b2.0 multiplier - a great straightforward project that is likely to be lasting and draw attention to the DAO. May result in future project work for the DAO.\u200b2.5 multiplier - a great complicated project that is likely to lead to other Members earning more (ex. Ketto Token Research)\u200b3.0 - an essential project for the DAO that creates immediate benefits (ex. Earnings Dashboard)\u200b4.0 - a flagship project for the DAO that brings many long-term benefits to the community (ex. Start on Solana)\u200bThe Reputation Leaderboard showcases the top contributors by skillset. Members with a lot of XP get asked to join high-paying and highly interesting projects. You can also use your XP in Superteam as a credential for working in Web3 more broadly. XP sources:There are four sources of XP:1. Permissionless BountiesType: Fixed and one-time XP, available for winning a bounty or reviewing a bounty.XPs for bounty wins are awarded automatically, when and if you've been invited to the community in any capacity, i.e., there is no need to fill out any forms for this.Find open bounties here.2. Indie ContributionType: Generally, fixed and one-time XP.Indie contributions take various forms - some with pre-defined XP listed in the XP Menu below, others requiring separate application. Upon approval by designated reviewers, the XP is awarded.Claim XP for an Indie contribution by posting a live link to your contribution (essays, merged GitHub PRs, etc.) on the #earn-xp channel in your Local Superteam server.The XP menu can be customized by your local Superteam lead. For more details, check the #earn-xp channel.Members of Superteam India & Germany receive 5XP for each community call they attend - this is automatically allocated i.e., there is no need to fill out any forms for this.3. Contributions to Grant Projects and Permissioned BountiesType: Variable and one-time XP, awarded once the project is shipped and marked as completed.For each project, the project lead is required to fill in the XP Claim form. He/she/they is/are accountable for presenting both qualitative and quantitative information about the team members' contributions, taking into account their significance and relevance to the project.The Reputation Lead will then add a multiplier to the final XP allocated.XPawarded = ProRataContribution * Total Project XP * MultiplierIn case you're uncertain about time and multiplier estimates, refer to this doc on XP allocation for Superteam Earn.Note: We ensure fair allocation of XPs across all projects by capping Total Time taken by the entire Team to reach their self-declared goal at 400 hours and limiting Individual XP to 3000XP.4. Superteam BraintrustMembers engaged in part-time/full-time community-focused work within Superteam receive fixed, recurring XP on a monthly basis, automatically granted at the end of each month.The amount of XP allotted per month is based on the tier of work, which is as follows:Full-time work: 700 XPProject leads: 500 XPPart-time work and other assistance: 250 XPGrantees shall start receiving XP once their contracts are effective.Note: If this feels a bit confusing right now, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll get more used to it as you contribute more to the community.

Occasionally, some sponsors might ask for invoices, KYC, etc. as per their respective payment processes.  When working in teams, who should make the submission/application?

Why We Focus on Community GDPHow to Contribute to Community GDPGetting Involved\ud83d\udcb8Community GDPOur North Star metricWhat is Community GDP? The Community GDP is our North Star metric. It captures the total amount of earning opportunities community members have created for each other. These opportunities may come in the form of bounties, jobs, grants, or other ad hoc work. Why We Focus on Community GDPFirst, the obvious reason: we believe that working (rather than speculating) in crypto is the best way to gain financial freedom. Focusing on how much our community earns - and orienting the structure of the community in that direction - is fundamental. Second, the less obvious reason: measuring earnings is the closest we can get to measuring the value created by the community. Just as GDP is an imprecise measure of an economy, Community GDP is an imprecise measure of our community. But, like with traditional economies, it's the closest we can get to seeing how productive we are. How to Contribute to Community GDPIf you earned through an opportunity created by another person in the Superteam community, you'e eligible to contribute to the Community GDP. Simply fill in this short form (~20 seconds) to get started. Contributing to Community GDP is the highest value thing a Superteam member can do. That's why every week we celebrate earners on the Community Call and have an entire Discord channel (#good-news) dedicated to recognizing earners.

The scope of work is completed by only the selected applicant(s).Participation Process:How can I submit to a Bounty or apply to a Project?\nSign up on earn.superteam.fun (verify email + make a talent profile) -> pick a listing -> apply / submit, if it's a Project or Bounty listing, respectively, by clicking on the \"Apply/Submit Now\" button. Do participants receive an email confirming their application?\nYes. An email is sent out to the verified email address of the participant to confirm their submission.What is the process for collecting payments for winners?\nSuperteam / Solana sponsored listings: A lead from Superteam will reach out to the winners with a payment form. Fill in that form and expect to receive the reward within 7 days of submitting the form. Note that the winner needs to complete KYC to receive money for Superteam / Solana-sponsored listings. \n\nExternal Sponsors: Generally, rewards for listings sponsored by external companies (i.e. listings not sponsored by Superteam / Solana) will be paid out to the wallet associated with the winner's Superteam Earn account. Occasionally, some sponsors might ask for invoices, KYC, etc. as per their respective payment processes.  When working in teams, who should make the submission/application? All team members or just the lead?\nIdeally, only the team lead should submit/apply to the listing. This means less redundancy for sponsors' review, truer numbers of actual submissions/applications, ease of making payments, etc. Can I make changes to my submission after submitting it?Currently no, that's not possible on Earn.Do I need to post my submission on Twitter (for listings which are not Twitter thread bounties)?While it\u2019s not mandatory, we recommend that participants tweet out their work so that:We can RT the best entries to give them more exposure, andIt makes it easier for sponsors to discover the participant's submissionRewards/Payouts on Superteam EarnWhat are the perks of winning a bounty or project?$$$: getting paid in global standardsSome listings can also offer additional perks such as NFTs, merch, etc.  Some listings also offer an invitation to become a Superteam Member/Contributor for the winners.

Do all listings provide membership as a perk?Not all listings offer community membership as a perk. Some rewards are limited to the prize pool.How do we manage rewards for teams?If a team is participating in an opportunity as opposed to an individual, the payment will be sent to the wallet address of a team member (ideally the team lead) who makes the actual submission on Earn. However, participants are free to divide the reward among the team members as they see fit.Announcements & Notifications:How are winners announced?All those who submit to a listing on Earn will get notified once the winners are announced.

However, in all other cases, the deadlines cannot be changed.What happens if the participant has already submitted to the listing and the deadline is extended?No further action is necessary from the participant's end. If the prize includes an invitation to become a Superteam Member, who would get the role?All teammates will get the role, promised!EvaluationHow are winners decided?Typically, sponsors conduct submission/application reviews and select the winners. However, In situations where their bandwidth is limited, a brain-trust member within Superteam might help evaluate the submissions and recommend the winners. This brain-trust member pool comprises of previous winners, people with high reputation within the community, etc.Sponsor ReferralsHow can I refer a sponsor to Superteam?\nYou can reach out to @pratikdholani on Telegram or Twitter and make an introduction.SponsorsHow are sponsors selected to list on Superteam Earn?Any Solana project can choose to sponsor a bounty or project through Superteam Earn, permissionlessly.

Why We Focus on Community GDPHow to Contribute to Community GDPGetting Involved\ud83d\udcb8Community GDPOur North Star metricWhat is Community GDP? The Community GDP is our North Star metric. It captures the total amount of earning opportunities community members have created for each other. These opportunities may come in the form of bounties, jobs, grants, or other ad hoc work. Why We Focus on Community GDPFirst, the obvious reason: we believe that working (rather than speculating) in crypto is the best way to gain financial freedom. Focusing on how much our community earns - and orienting the structure of the community in that direction - is fundamental. Second, the less obvious reason: measuring earnings is the closest we can get to measuring the value created by the community. Just as GDP is an imprecise measure of an economy, Community GDP is an imprecise measure of our community. But, like with traditional economies, it's the closest we can get to seeing how productive we are. How to Contribute to Community GDPIf you earned through an opportunity created by another person in the Superteam community, you'e eligible to contribute to the Community GDP. Simply fill in this short form (~20 seconds) to get started. Contributing to Community GDP is the highest value thing a Superteam member can do. That's why every week we celebrate earners on the Community Call and have an entire Discord channel (#good-news) dedicated to recognizing earners.

Forking > VotingGetting started\ud83c\udf1fCore ValuesWe value the sovereignty that comes with founding a company, the skin in the game that comes with investing, and the joy that comes with getting sh*t done. In a pre-crypto world, we had to fit into broiler categories. Web3 allows us to be free-range.We've built our community on the following core values: 1. Ownership EconomyPeople who help create value should capture a piece of it. We see crypto as a profound tool to create and distribute wealth in the most meritocratic way at a time of historic wealth inequality. Less rent-seeking, more ownership.2. Permissionless WorkMake it easy for people contribute and get out of their way. Reduce middle management, recruiters and bureaucracy.3. Work Flexible HoursThe industrial era is over. It is time for us to take control of our own work. Work the hours you want as long as you deliver. You\u2019re accountable to the community, not to a middle manager. The more you do, the more you own.4. Work RemotelyMoving to a city and leaving your friends and family to find a job is a thing of the past. Time Zone is the new location. All you need to do is be available on Discord, Crypto Twitter, Slack, and email.5. Community GDP as a North StarThe core contributors are in service of using the resources of the collective (capital, distribution, time etc.) in nurturing community GDP \u2014 the total wealth generated for the members of the group.6. Fluid Squads > Calcified StructuresLeadership, if any is ephemeral \u2014 for the duration and scope of the mission.7. Multi Chain FutureWhile we're committed to the growth of the Solana network, we believe in a multi-chain future. Please leave maximalism at the door. We see Solana as critical infrastructure needed to create an open, financial internet and get a billion people to self-custody their private keys.8. Decentralisation means More LeadersDecentralisation means an abundance of leadership, not a lack of it. We acknowledge that every great company or project had the stewardship of a good leader \u2014 and our goal is to create many leaders who can ship value to the world, using the DAO\u2019s common resources as a springboard to bring their ideas to life.9.

Why We Focus on Community GDPHow to Contribute to Community GDPGetting Involved\ud83d\udcb8Community GDPOur North Star metricWhat is Community GDP? The Community GDP is our North Star metric. It captures the total amount of earning opportunities community members have created for each other. These opportunities may come in the form of bounties, jobs, grants, or other ad hoc work. Why We Focus on Community GDPFirst, the obvious reason: we believe that working (rather than speculating) in crypto is the best way to gain financial freedom. Focusing on how much our community earns - and orienting the structure of the community in that direction - is fundamental. Second, the less obvious reason: measuring earnings is the closest we can get to measuring the value created by the community. Just as GDP is an imprecise measure of an economy, Community GDP is an imprecise measure of our community. But, like with traditional economies, it's the closest we can get to seeing how productive we are. How to Contribute to Community GDPIf you earned through an opportunity created by another person in the Superteam community, you'e eligible to contribute to the Community GDP. Simply fill in this short form (~20 seconds) to get started. Contributing to Community GDP is the highest value thing a Superteam member can do. That's why every week we celebrate earners on the Community Call and have an entire Discord channel (#good-news) dedicated to recognizing earners.
